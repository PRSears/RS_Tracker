[March 3 2014]
	Fixed UserTrackerTabs not having their TabClosing events subscribed to by MainForm
	Fixed SkillTrackerBars not closing when the bar is constructed by TrackingState.Load() (the BarClosing event was never subscribed to)
	Fixed bug where closing all tabs would disable the option of opening a new one
	Fixed issue where SkillTrackerBars created by TrackingState.Load() wouldn't show previous xp/goal/rank
	Removed Skill.Visible attribute. (Never used)
	Fixed issue where removed Controls were not getting disposed of
	Added ControlUpdatedEventHandler, and subscribed to it in MainForm to save UIState
	Rewrote Highscores to use static methods
	Fixed error in Highscores parsing where new minigames weren't recognized (caused crash)
	Fixed references to Player objects between UiState.Load() > tabs > bars
	Removed calls to database / highscores in Player object. It is now (correctly) only used to encapsulate data relevant to the player
	Highscores now inserts latest scores into the database
	Fixed progress bar not showing progress (since long / long was always rounding down to 0). Really fucking annoying, but everything had to be cast to double first.
	Fixed *ExpBox text justification behaviour
	Fixed GoalBox text entry and parsing
	Fixed Skill.LevelAtExperience and Skill.ExperienceAtLevel behaviour to properly account for total xp greater than 200,000,000 (MaxSkillXP)
	Fixed UserTrackerTab.usernameTextBox not showing the correct username on loaded tabs
	Fixed bug where TabPage.Text wasn't changing (TabControl was calling TabPage.Text when it was redrawing instead of UserTrackerTab.Text) when a new user was being tracked
	...And probably more that I forgot / fixed along the way with the other bullshit. I should have split up the commits, but it's been a very obsessive day.
